## Description

It's just as vital to write about technology as it is to make it. Most developers spend at least some of their time researching and writing about technical concepts, current breakthroughs, and new technologies, in addition to building new applications and troubleshooting old code bases.

This website was created from the ground up and is hosted on Heroku. Using Handlebars, the application follows the MVC paradigm. The template language is js, the ORM is Sequelize, and authentication is handled via the express-session npm package.
